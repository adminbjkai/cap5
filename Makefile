up:
	docker compose -p $(PROJECT) up -d --build

down:
	docker compose -p $(PROJECT) down

# Follow logs for all services.

# Re-run the migration runner against the running database.
# Useful after adding a new migration file without a full restart.

	docker compose -p $(PROJECT) run --rm migrate

# Hard-reset: wipe volumes and restart from scratch.
# Migrations run automatically on fresh startup — no manual SQL needed.
